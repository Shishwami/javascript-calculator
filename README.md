# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a **JavaScript Calculator App** inspired by FreeCodeCamp's challenge. It was built to meet specific user stories, ensuring full functionality and responsiveness while adding a personal touch to its design and features.

## Project Overview

The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with precision and follows logical calculation rules. It features a responsive UI and dynamic interactivity, offering both immediate execution and formula-based evaluation logic.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: To build the dynamic, component-based UI.
- **Sass**: For styling, leveraging CSS extensions like variables and nested syntax.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the calculator logic.
- **FreeCodeCamp Testing CDN**: To validate and test the appâ€™s functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the app locally.

Alternatively, you can view the live version of the project at [this link](https://shishwami.github.io/javascript-calculator/).

## Usage

1. Click on the number and operator buttons to input a calculation.
2. Use the "=" button to evaluate the expression.
3. Click "C" to clear the display and reset the calculator.

## User Stories
This app fulfills the following requirements:

1. Contains clickable elements for numbers (0-9) and basic operators (+, -, *, /).
2. Includes functionality for decimals and clears the display when the "AC" button is pressed.
3. Displays input and output dynamically in the display area.
4. Handles operator precedence and formula-based logic.
5. Prevents invalid inputs, such as multiple decimals in a single number.
6. For a complete list of user stories, refer to the [FreeCodeCamp project description](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).
